# DogAlien Invasion
DogAlien Invasion is a game based on an example from a book "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition" by Eric Matthes.
The player takes on the role the role of the dog superhero Kleopatra (my doggy), who tries to stop a fleet of dangerous dog aliens. The objective of the game is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens (by using Kleopatra's stocks of balls she loves), preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. The speed of the dog alien approach increases as the game progresses, adding to the tension. How many aliens can brave Kleopatra defeat?
